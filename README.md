# roclothestest 0.7.71*
this is for roblox stuff okay

*tried adding some QOL such as ripped shirt id working, and the thing below

0.7.71 uhh i forgot to add in .61 stuff mb

0.7.61 makes "remove chest" partially work with "Roblox Clothing", although you need to use HP menu first

it was also complicated to add the 0.7.51 stuff back to 0.7.61 

v2 is a test one
