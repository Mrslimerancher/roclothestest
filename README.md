# roclothestest 0.7.81*
this is for roblox stuff okay

*tried adding some QOL such as ripped shirt id working, and the thing below
# ATTEMPTING TO IMPORT 7.72 STUFF INTO 7.81

0.7.72 added hp clothes display + progress, repair clothes for mobile is very scuffed (also keybind for pc is \)

0.7.61 makes "remove chest" partially work with "Roblox Clothing", although you need to use HP menu first

it was also complicated to add the 0.7.51 stuff back to 0.7.61 

v3 is work in progress
